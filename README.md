# CIS519_Project
This is our project analyzing how tennis data can be used to predict the outcome of a match between two players
# To Do
## Models
* SVM
* Neural Nets
* Logistic Regression

## Methods
* Common Opponent Model for Feature Generation
* Symmetry of examples
* Ablation Study

## Presentation
* Report
* Poster

To Do:
* Cross Validation
* Experience feature?
* What plots to make?
* Models
* Ablation study

Right now:
    - Fully experiment with SVM
    - Generate some graphs
    - Cross Validation
    - Ablation Study
    - Derived Features

    Added features:
        - surface
        - completeness
